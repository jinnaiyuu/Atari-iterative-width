/****************************************************************************************
** Implementation of a variation of BASS Features, which has features to encode the 
**  relative position between tiles.
**
** REMARKS: - This implementation is basically Erik Talvitie's implementation, presented
**            in the AAAI'15 LGCVG Workshop.

 		* REMARKS: - It is necessary to provide both the screen and the ram because of the superclass,
 		* despite the RAM being useless here. In fact a null pointer works just fine.
 		*          - To avoid return huge vectors, this method is void and the appropriate
 		* vector is returned trough a parameter passed by reference.
 		*          - This method was adapted from Sriram Srinivasan's code
 		* 
 		* @param ALEScreen &screen is the current game screen that one may use to extract features.
 		* @param ALERAM &ram is the current game RAM that one may use to extract features.
 		* @param vector<int>& features an empy vector that will be filled with the requested information,
 		*        therefore it must be passed by reference. It contain the active indices.
 		* @return nothing as one will receive the requested data by the last parameter, by reference.

 		* between these three quantities.
