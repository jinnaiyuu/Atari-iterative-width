	 * despite the RAM being useless here. In fact a null pointer works just fine.
	 *          - To avoid return huge vectors, this method is void and the appropriate
	 * vector is returned trough a parameter passed by reference.
	 *          - This method was adapted from Sriram Srinivasan's code
	 *
	 * @param ALEScreen &screen is the current game screen that one may use to extract features.
	 * @param ALERAM &ram is the current game RAM that one may use to extract features.
	 * @param vector<int>& features an empy vector that will be filled with the requested information,
	 *        therefore it must be passed by reference. It contain the active indices.
	 * @return nothing as one will receive the requested data by the last parameter, by reference.
